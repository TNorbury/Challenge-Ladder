      <h3>What is a ladder? Let me tell you!</h3>

      <ul>
         <li>A ladder is a challenge system that allows user to challenge other people on the ladder (up to 3 ranks above them) in order to move up the ladder</li>
         <li>Challenging someone on the ladder means that you're going to enter into a match against them:</li>
         <ul>
            <li>A match is a best of 5 series of games</li>
            <li>A game is played to 15 points, however you must win by 2 points</li>
         </ul>
